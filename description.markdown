A short data story / micro-project

> *Exercise*: Create a short data-story based on the work we've done in class so far. (This exercise is a kind of "micro version" of what we'll be doing in the final project). Follow the directions in the bulleted list below when you create your data-story.

* **Find your own story to tell in the work on analyzing the SF Crime Data that we've done so far** (Week 1 - Week 6). The idea is to choose an insight about crime in SF (perhaps how something changed over the years) and communicate that insight to a general audience reader. (Don't use the prostitution data since we covered that last week. )
* The web-page should be hosted on your GitHub Pages site (Week 7).
* The format must be the classic *Magazine Genre* presented on a single web-page (see the Segel \& Heer paper for details). **Important**: You don't need to do two columns. What I mean by *magazine style* is simply that it's a classic structure where you read from top to bottom and don't jump around in some fancy way.
* The story should have a brief introduction to the dataset so new readers from outside the class can understand what's going on.
* Your story should include three visualizations. Not more than three, not less than three (but multi-panel figures are OK). The figures should be one of each of the following types
  - One time-series / bar chart (it's OK to use the "fancy" plot-typs like calendar plots or polar bar-charts if you think those help you tell the story.
  - One map
  - One interactive visualization in Bokeh (Week 6)
* **At a minimum, the Bokeh visualization should contain different data than the exercise we did for Week 6** (it's a plus if it's a new type of viz altogether). 
* The two other visualization may be repetitions of figures created during the previous lectures, or they may be new.
* Make the figures nice. Specifically:
  - Aim to make the figures visually consistent (color, fonts, etc).
  - Follow the recommendations from my video on nice figures.
* In terms of the amount of text, I envision something like 500-1500 words (including figure captions). <font color="gray">Please write in your own words. Some LLMs have a tendency to write a lot of text and not be so precise. So if the writing is all elegantly written but empty prose, we will be critical. It is OK, however, to have the LLM help you get the grammer, etc. right.</font>
* It is a plus if you can back up some of your findings with external sources, such as news stories from the area, looking up which building is located at some set of `lat,lon` coordinates, or similar. (So when you see something happening at some time/place in the data, see if you can understand it more deeply by investigating outside the dataset.) Use real references at the end of the text to organize your links to the outside world.

In general, I hope you will use LLMs as little as possible for this assignment. Use your brain, think critically, find good stories and write about them.  There are also some gray text above with extra hints.
